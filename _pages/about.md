I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in machine learning at POSTECH under the supervision of Professor Won Hwa Kim. My research revolves around modeling generative models using dynamical systems. Previously, I specialized in modeling marked temporal point processes using Neural ODEs. Currently, I am exploring diffusion networks for graph structures using topological data analysis.

##### Research Interest
- Time Series Analysis
- Explainable AI
- Medical Data Analysis
- Generative Model
- Graph Machine Learning
